#ZooOOP-Java

A beginner-friendly Java project demonstrating core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles such as:

- âœ… Inheritance
- âœ… Polymorphism
- âœ… Encapsulation
- âœ… Interfaces and Implementation
- âœ… Collections (`ArrayList`)
- âœ… Method Overriding

## Project Overview

This project simulates a virtual zoo where each animal is represented as a class extending from a base `Animal` class. Some animals implement the `Trainable` interface to perform tricks. The `Zoo` class manages a collection of animals and can trigger their sounds and behaviors.

### Key Classes

- `Animal`: Base class with common properties and methods for all animals.
- `Lion`, `Elephant`, `Monkey`: Subclasses representing specific animal types.
- `Trainable`: Interface for animals that can perform tricks.
- `Zoo`: Class to manage and display animals and their behaviors.
